# SugarBrookFarm
SugarBrook Farm uses a method of growing plants in vertically stacked layers, using hydroponics and machine learning. The plants are grown in a controlled environment, inside a greenhouse or warehouse, and are supplied with nutrient-rich water, light, and other necessary inputs. This method of farming has several potential benefits, including the ability to grow crops year-round, reduced water and fertilizer usage, and increased crop yield per unit of land. We grow a wide range of crops, including leafy greens, herbs, and small fruits. Additionally, because vertical farming is typically done indoors, it can be used to grow crops in urban areas where land is scarce.
